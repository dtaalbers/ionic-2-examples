## Ionic Example App
## Note: state has been removed and ionic recommends using Cordova as of now. This example won't compile anymore.
#### # Intro

Hi there! Here you can find the Ionic Example App. This app contains different examples on how to use the Ionic Framework. If you can't find your example, don't hesitate to create a issue and request an example!

Next to the app I've also open sourced the code of the api (.NET Core `dotnet core`) that is running for the Ionic Example App. The endpoint for that api is `https://api.dtaalbers.com/ionic-example-app/`. Add `ping` to the url to ping the api so you can check if it is running.

If you have questions and/or remarks, please make an issue and we can discuss it!
